# RobotCode_DoxygenOutput

This repository documents our robot code, stored in the repository entitled
RobotCode.

If you are using the command line version of Git, clone the repository by
using the command (without the quotes):

"git clone https://github.com/FRC-7464-ORION/RobotCode_DoxygenOutput.git"

Go to the RobotCode_DoxygenOutput folder, and go into the "html" folder.

Then, double click on "index.html".

That will get you started.

It really helps to use this with the WPILib documentation, which is found at:

http://first.wpi.edu/FRC/roborio/release/docs/cpp/

or, if you have installed the software on your PC,

file:///C:/Users/Public/frc2019/documentation/cpp/index.html.

Also, at the root of this repository, is a file called cloc.txt.
(Note: CLOC = Count Lines Of Code)

Open it up with your editor of choice, and it will show the following about our
source code:

1. Number of C++ files.
2. Number of C/C++ header files.
3. Number of blank lines in the files.
4. Number of comment lines in the files.
5. Number of lines of code in the files.

Very useful information when developing software.
